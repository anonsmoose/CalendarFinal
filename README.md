# Introduction

The software engineering class (CSC309) is one of the main practical upper-year course at U of T and in the year I took the course, there wasn't any final exam. Instead, the course had one large project, where a group of seven would use an agile process to complete and present a project in front of the class. This involved learning Javascript, databases, HTML, CSS and front-end frameworks. Our group decided on making a course planner that would work for all three U of T campuses.
